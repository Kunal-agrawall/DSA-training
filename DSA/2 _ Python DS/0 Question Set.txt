1. Wap to sum all the items in a list.

2. WAP to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.
    Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
    Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]

3. WAP that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.

4. Write a Python program to sort a given list of non-empty tuples in increasing order by the sum of elements in each tuple.
    Sample List:
        [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]
    Expected Result:
        [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 5), (4, 4)]

5. Write a Python program to get the 4th element from the last element of a tuple.

6. Write a Python program to replace the last value of tuples in a list.
    Sample list:
        [(10, 20, 40), (40, 50, 60), (70, 80, 90)]
    Expected Output:
        [(10, 20, 100), (40, 50, 100), (70, 80, 100)]

7. Write a Python program to remove an empty tuple(s) from a list of tuples.
    Sample data:
        [(), (), ('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), ('d')]
    Expected output:
        [('',), ('a', 'b'), ('a', 'b', 'c'), 'd']
        
8. Write a Python program to find all the unique words and count the frequency of occurrence from a given list of strings. Use Python set data type.

9. Write a Python program to find the two numbers whose product is maximum among all the pairs in a given list of numbers. Use the Python set.

10. Write a Python program to find all the unique combinations of 3 numbers from a given list of numbers, adding up to a target number.

11. You are given a string str, you need to return True if  the words "cat" and "hat" appear same number of times in str, otherwise return False.
    Note: str contains only lowercase English alphabets.
       
    Example 1:
        Input:
            str = catinahat
        Output:
            True
        Explanation: cat and hat both are present 1 number of times.
