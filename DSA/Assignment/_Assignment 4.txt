1- Write a Python function to find the maximum of three numbers.

2- Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.
Sample List : (8, 2, 3, 0, 7)
Expected Output : 20

3- Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.
Sample List : (8, 2, 3, -1, 7)
Expected Output : -336

4- Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with distinct elements from the first list.
Sample List : [1,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

5- Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list.
Sample List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
Expected Result : [2, 4, 6, 8]

6- Write a Python function to check whether a number is "Perfect" or not.
According to Wikipedia : In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, that is, the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum). Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors (including itself).
Example : The first perfect number is 6, because 1, 2, and 3 are its proper positive divisors, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Equivalently, the number 6 is equal to half the sum of all its positive divisors: ( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 ) / 2 = 6. The next perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14. This is followed by the perfect numbers 496 and 8128.

7- Write a Python program that accepts a hyphen-separated sequence of words as input and prints the words in a hyphen-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Sample Items : green-red-yellow-black-white
Expected Result : black-green-red-white-yellow

8- Write a Python program that invokes a function after a specified period of time.
Sample Output:
Square root after specific miliseconds:
4.0
10.0
